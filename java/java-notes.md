# Setting Up VS Code

- Download JDK zip file and extract in `C:/` drive or `/opt`.
- store java bin in JAVA_HOME evn: ` export JAVA_HOME='C:\project\jdk-17'`

JVM is platform dependent but the Java application you build is independent of OS by using same JVM. Note that JVM needs byte code and therefore we need to compile the application for byte code conversion using `javac`. The `javac` expects file to be compiled to have `main` method which will be called `javac`. `jre` is the runtime environment.

> Java is `WORA`, `Write Once, Run Anywhere`.
